        "title": "Rick Sanchez",
        "text": "A genius scientist who is the father of Beth Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer. His alcoholic tendencies lead his daughter's family to worry about the safety of their son Morty. The series is often retroscripted for Rick's lines. He displays 'diagnosable qualities of various mental illnesses'. An extremely intellectual character that views his time as valuable, he disparages the usefulness of many ordinary human conventions such as school, marriage, and even love, though he displays genuine affection towards his grandchildren and daughter throughout the series. His reaction to the mundane requests asked of him by Morty and other family members suggests he considers himself wholly superior to them, though in several instances throughout the series he shows a lonelier side. He frequently 'burp-talks' words in the middle of a sentence while speaking, presumably as a result of his alcoholism. He is identified as Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-137.",

She is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she internally feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her career is compared to human medicine. Level-headed and assertive, she struggles with her husband's ego, which thrives in defiance of his proven mediocrity. Several episodes have dealt with Beth's deep dissatisfaction with her life, stemming from her belief that she has 'settled' in her marriage, family, and job. She wanted to become a 'real' surgeon but became pregnant with Summer at 17. She is the most assertive force in her household, while also displaying traits of selfishness, humor, and intelligence. Beth is unperturbed by her father's destructive and dangerous tendencies around her son. ",

        "text": "Summer and Morty's insecure father, Beth's husband, and Rick's son-in-law, who strongly disapproves of Rick's influence over his family. Jerry used to work at a low-level advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence. Generally insecure, he is frequently led into conflicts stemming from opportunistic posturing, while his marriage is sometimes jeopardized by his wife's reactions to his poor relationship with Rick. Beth views Jerry as meek under his boasts, ultimately fearful of confrontation. However, it is strongly suggested that in spite of their problems, they are emotionally co-dependent. The episode 'Mortynight Run' reveals that one of the Ricks, keenly aware that every Jerry is incapable of surviving off of Earth, created a daycare where every Jerry is dropped off by their Rick and Morty during adventures should they attempt to accompany them. It is revealed in the same episode that in some dimensions, Beth has left Jerry and remarried. ",

        "text": "Morty's 17-year-old older sister, a more conventional and often superficial teenager, who is obsessed with improving her status among her peers. Summer is generally similar to her mother, as she is often shown to be very smart and humorous, but she has also shown elements of Jerry's approval-seeking. She occasionally expresses jealousy that Morty gets to accompany Rick on his inter-dimensional adventures. In the second season, she accompanies Rick and Morty on adventures more frequently and sometimes will even prove herself to be more competent than Morty, especially when emotional nuance is required. Summer has, on occasion, been shown to think similar to Rick, such as quickly figuring out a way to save herself and Rick from execution, and correctly deducing that dead flies in Rick's garage were more than they appeared. Summer cares about Rick, and sees him as a hero. In 'The Rickshank Rickdemption', she is the only member of the family who wants to rescue Rick despite the pleas of her brother that Rick is nothing more than a selfish jerk. When their parents agreed on a divorce, Summer began resenting her father and started showing her dark side, until she reconciles with him.",

After election, Evil Morty proceeds to assassinate a shadow cabinet of Ricks who were the true power behind the scenes, and starts grand plans for reform for his own nefarious end."
